The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines; neural networks and deep learning; survival models; multiple testing. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).  This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chapter.  The lectures cover all the material in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani and Taylor (Springer, 2023). The pdf for this book is available for free on the book website.

The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines; neural networks and deep learning; survival models; multiple testing. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).  This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chapter.

The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines; neural networks and deep learning; survival models; multiple testing. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).  This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chapter.  The lectures cover all the material in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani and Taylor (Springer, 2023). The pdf for this book is available for free on the book website.

The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines; neural networks and deep learning; survival models; multiple testing. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).

Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).  This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chapter.  The lectures cover all the material in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani and Taylor (Springer, 2023). The pdf for this book is available for free on the book website.

This course will cover the setting where there are multiple tasks to be solved, and study how the structure arising from multiple tasks can be leveraged to learn more efficiently or effectively. This includes:  self-supervised pre-training for downstream few-shot learning and transfer learning meta-learning methods that aim to learn efficient learning algorithms that can learn new tasks quickly curriculum and lifelong learning, where the problem requires learning a sequence of tasks, leveraging their shared structure to enable knowledge transfer  This is a graduate-level course. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand and implement the state-of-the-art multi-task learning and meta-learning algorithms and be ready to conduct research on these topics.|bkVCAk9Nsss|Stanford Online

Students will learn about the core challenges and approaches in the field, including generalization and exploration.  Through a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments, students will become well-versed in key ideas and techniques for RL. Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning-- an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning. In addition, students will advance their understanding and the field of RL through an open-ended project.
