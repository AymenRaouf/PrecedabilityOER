It is the second semester in the freshman calculus sequence. Topics include vectors and matrices, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, and vector calculus in 2 and 3-space.  MIT OpenCourseWare offers another version of 18.02, from the Spring 2006 term. Both versions cover the same material, although they are taught by different faculty and rely on different textbooks. Multivariable Calculus (18.02) is taught during the Fall and Spring terms at MIT, and is a required subject for all MIT undergraduates.

21|Computer Science|PLUl4u3cNGP60UlabZBeeqOuoLuj_KNphQ|MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Spring 2015|Albert R. Meyer  This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.
