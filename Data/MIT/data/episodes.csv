In addition to a brief review for the course final exam, the overflowing audience (both in person and on the live YouTube stream) heard recollections, appreciations, and congratulations from Prof. Strang’s colleagues and former students.  A rousing standing ovation concluded this historic event.  This video has been dubbed using an artificial voice via https://aloud.area120.google.com to increase accessibility.

The series was first released in 1970 as a way for people to review the essentials of calculus.  It is equally valuable for students who are learning calculus for the first time.  About the Instructor:  Herb Gross has taught math as senior lecturer at MIT and was the founding math department chair at Bunker Hill Community College.  He is the developer of the Mathematics As A Second Language website, providing arithmetic and algebra materials to elementary and middle school teachers.

Meyer  This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

Meyer  This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into thirds:  1)Fundamental concepts of mathematics: Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations. 2)Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting. 3)Discrete probability theory.  On completion of 6.042J, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer systems.

This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month. The course can be tailored to a normal semester time line.|r7rLHHd43MU|MIT OpenCourseWare

Through original research, creative hands-on projects, readings, and lectures, the following topics will be explored. The history of radio, audio recording, and the recording studio, as well as the development of musique concrète and early electronic instruments. The creation and extension of musical interfaces by composers such as Harry Partch, John Cage, Conlon Nancarrow, and others. The exploration of electromagnetic technologies in pickups, and the development of dub, hip-hop, and turntablism. The history and application of the analog synthesizer, from the Moog modular to the Roland TR-808. The history of computer music, including music synthesis and representation languages. Contemporary practices in circuit bending, live electronics, and electro-acoustic music, as well as issues in copyright and intellectual property, will also be examined. No prerequisites.
